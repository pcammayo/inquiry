        <h3>Why should one be patient?</h3>
          <p>One should be patient because it is essential for success, wisdom, and overcoming frustration. To begin, patience is one of the major keys to success. This is true in the case of Alan Turing when he was building an enigma machine to decode German communication. After two years of creating the perfect machine, the government lost patience in his machine and threatened to fire him if results were not produced within one more month. In that same month, Alan was given he made a few major adjustments which allowed him to crack the code with his machine. Secondly, patience is essential for overcoming frustration because when Alan’s machine was not working he did not just give up because it wasn’t working. He was persistent in figuring out how to improve his machine. Which ended up being a success in the end. Lastly, patience is essential for obtaining wisdom because wisdom is not obtained easily. It is something that is gained from experience. In relation, Alan spent most of his life solving and encrypting puzzles which led him to believe that the German enigma was said to be “impossible” to decode was possible to decode. In conclusion, success, overcoming frustration, and wisdom are three of the many traits that come from patience.</p>

        <h3>How can one be patient?</h3>
          <p>One can be patient by either waiting for something to happen, being persistent, or by having self-control. Firstly, one can be patient by waiting for something to happen. This is something that we all struggle with whether it be waiting for your food to be served at a restaurant, or commercials during exciting TV shows. We can overcome this by just waiting. It may sound like a painful solution but according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614546556">Psychological Sciences</a>, waiting for things makes us happier in the long-run. Secondly, one can be patient by being persistent. For instance, you are struggling to find an inquiry project that you are interested in. Do you give up? Of course not, because persistence is the practice of pursuing a goal until you have achieved it. Lastly, one can be patient by being calm and controlled. For example, you are invited to eat out with a few friends and they end up being 30 minutes late. Do you complain or keep calm? It would obviously be better to not complain because there are no good outcomes from it. In conclusion, being persistent, having self-control, and being able to wait for something is a few of the main qualities of a patient person.</p>

        <h3>Can one be too patient?</h3>
          <p>Yes, an individual can become too patient by making themselves more prone to being used, waiting for results, and miss opportunities given to them. To begin with, an individual can become too patient because it makes them more prone to being used. For example, a friend decides to do their homework later when another can help them even though they could have completed the assignment themselves. Secondly, an individual can be too patient by waiting for results. For example, an individual gets an offer from McDonald's but wants a job from Tim Hortons where their friend works. So they end up putting the job offer on hold while they continue to wait for a response from Tim Hortons. 2 weeks passed by and McDonald's loses interests in the individual because of the vast amount of others who are willing to take up the job offer. So by waiting for results the individual doesn’t get any job. Lastly, an individual can become too patient because it leads them to missing opportunities given to them. For instance, you are working on an inquiry project and you end up not using class time effectively. In conclusion, being too patient can lead to being used, waiting for results, and missing important opportunities.</p>
